# Voicecommands
Its a basic customized voice commands
It uses the module SpeechRecognition to listen and Recognize_Google to undertand and translate whatever you said into strings.
This is the python file, i use the executable in my computer, which means that i have to activate the program whenever i want to use it, i use it that way to avoid using more resources than necesary.
In order to use the program you must customize the code and enter your own paths(directorys from the apps you want open).
If you need any help reach me from my discord on my github profile.
